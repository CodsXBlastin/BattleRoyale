#DISCONTIUNED FOR THE TIME BEING

## BattleRoyale
BattleRoyale also Known as Battlegrounds is a gamemode where a set amount of players go(land) into a map and gather weapons to then become the last player standing.

## Customization
You have free reign over what you do with the plugin VIA the config.yml and default.yml files.


## How To Install
1: Download the .phar file from https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/.                                                                                 
2: Place the .phar file inside your Server's Directory for Plugins (Almost 100% of the time Called and Reffered to as /plugins/).         
3: Configure the file how you see fit.                                                                                                     
4: Restart your server.                                                                                                                   
5: Have a hell of a time playing.                                                                                                         

## IMPORTANT
This plugin DOESN'T support spoons/varients of PocketMine. Support for such are few and far between. I repeat DO NOT use this plugin with spoons/varients of PocketMine.
I will attempt to add more languages to the file when i see fit.
